# Antibiotics-associated-diarrhea-I
Antibiotics associated Diarrhea is a worldwide economically important disease in human. The disease is Caused by disturbance in the commensal bacteria that is followed by either colonization of pathogenic bacteria named Clostridioides difficile, referenced to as CDI (C. difficile infection) or diarrhea caused by the disturbance itself, referenced to as AAD (Antibiotics associated Diarrhea), or experienced no Diarrhea (ND).
To ad dress this a prospective clinical trial across 6 European countries (France, Netherland, Spain, Romania, Germany, Greece) was conducted and ~ 1000 patients were enrolled. The inclusion criteria were the fact they are CDI negative, haven’t taken Antibiotics prior to the enrolment. Patients received on of a three classes of Antibiotics and were sampled on Day1 (just before the antibiotics) and again on Day6, then they were monitored for 90 days and their stool samples (in case of diarrhea) were collected. 
•	A: PBL: penicillin + beta-lactamase inhibitor. 
•	OBL: other beta-lactamase antibiotics. 
•	FQN: fluoroquinolones. 
The samples were sequenced using 16S microbial profiling and their microbial richness (Chao) and evenness (Shannon) and beta-diversity distance (between D1 and D6, Jclass) was assessed.
We are interested in the following outcomes:
•	Changes in between the baseline samples across various countries, gender and age-stratas
•	Changes over time (D1, D6 and Stool) for each antibiotic
•	Changes across antibiotics over time
